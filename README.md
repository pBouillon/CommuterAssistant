## Getting started

### Telegram

To get your [Telegram](https://telegram.org) API key, send a message to
[BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Once its done you should have a token that
looks something like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`, paste it in
along with your username like in the following example:

[`Assistant/Assistant/appsettings.json`](./Assistant/Assistant/appsettings.json):

```json
{
  "BotConfiguration": {
    "ApiKey": "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11",
    "AllowedUsers": ["your-telegram-username"]
  }
}
```

> Your API key and all of your data will remain private, no data is ever shared
> outside of your application with any database or any third party system except
> the [Telegram Bot API client](https://github.com/TelegramBots/telegram.bot).

Once you've set up your credentials, run the run the project `Assistant` and
start messaging your your bot. You should see your messages logged in your
console.
